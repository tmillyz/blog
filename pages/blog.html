          <p><p><span class="firstword">In</span> the summer, temperatures may increase to the hottest of the year. If they spike too high, heat waves
            or droughts may cause trouble for people, animals, and plants. For example, in the summer of 2003, the high temperatures claimed more 
            than 30,000 lives, according to <span class="changecolor">Encyclopedia Britannica</span>. Rainfall may increase in some areas, as well. Others may receive less water, 
            and forest fires may become more frequent. 
         </p>
            <p>A well written post should have atleast<b> 3 paragraphs or potentially 5 or more sentences.</b>
              These can also include <span class="changecolor">qutoes, graphs, and other images</span> that will draw the persons attention. 
              Getting your readers to actually click on and completely read an article will depend on your delivery
              as well as your digital marketing efforts.
            </p>
            <p>Knowing and understanding SEO would be a good thing to learn if you want to start a blog.
              One of the things that is important to know in marketing is who your target audience is. <span class="changecolor"> Who are the people that you are 
              trying to reach? </span>Is it men or women? Old or young? People that think like you or those that have differing opinions?
              Blogging can be a very lucrative side hustle as well.  I think people that like to write and can come up with content should look into
              creating their own blogs!
